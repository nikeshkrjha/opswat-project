The main timing for the storms will be Tuesday afternoon into Tuesday night. 
Showers and storms could already bring poor weather to parts of the southern Plains during the day 
Tuesday, but the severe threat won't ramp up until the end of the day when storms fire up across 
western Texas and then track east.

The risk for isolated severe storms will persist into Wednesday.
